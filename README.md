# 3D Solar System Simulation

A responsive web-based 3D solar system simulation built with Three.js. This project creates an interactive visualization of our solar system with realistic planet movements and customizable controls.

## 🌟 Features

### Core Features

- **3D Solar System Visualization**
  - Realistic rendering of the Sun and all 8 planets
  - Accurate relative sizes and distances
  - Smooth orbital animations with proper speeds
  - Realistic lighting effects

### Interactive Controls

- **Planet Speed Controls**
  - Individual speed sliders for each planet
  - Adjustable range: 0.1x to 5x default speed
  - Real-time speed adjustments

### Bonus Features

- **Theme Switching**

  - Toggle between dark and light modes
  - Automatically adjusts orbit visibility
  - Maintains visual clarity in both themes

- **Interactive Elements**
  - Planet labels on hover
  - Click to zoom on planets
  - Pause/Resume animation control
  - Background starfield effect

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- No additional software or build tools required

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. No build process or dependencies to install
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser

### Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. The solar system will automatically start animating
3. Use the control panel on the right to adjust settings

## 🎮 Controls

### Speed Controls

- Located in the right-side control panel
- Each planet has its own speed slider
- Drag sliders to adjust orbital speeds
- Changes take effect immediately

### Theme Controls

- Click "Toggle Theme" to switch between dark and light modes
- Automatically adjusts all visual elements
- Maintains visibility of orbits in both themes

### Interactive Features

- **Hover**: Move mouse over planets to see their names
- **Click**: Click on a planet to zoom in
- **Pause/Resume**: Toggle animation with the pause button

## 💻 Technical Details

### Technologies Used

- **Three.js** (r128) for 3D rendering
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for interactivity
- **HTML5** and **CSS3** for structure and styling

### Key Components

- **Scene Setup**: 3D environment with proper lighting
- **Planet System**: Realistic planet models and orbits
- **Controls**: Interactive speed and theme controls
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### Performance Considerations

- Optimized for smooth animations
- Efficient use of Three.js features
- Responsive design for all devices
- No external dependencies

## 🌐 Browser Support

- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
- Any modern browser with WebGL support

## 📝 Notes

- All animations are handled by JavaScript
- The simulation uses realistic relative sizes and distances
- The project is self-contained and requires no external dependencies
- Orbits are visible in both dark and light themes
